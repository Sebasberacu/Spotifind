# Spotifind

This is a web application based on the Spotify App. In it i was able to use the Spotify's service, and could also create very different components and pages, through implementations such as **search** albums, artists, tracks; save search history; and also create pages for both albums and artists.

Created and built using Angular 17 framework.

This project was made as the final assignment for a web development course i took in late 2023 - early 2024. It was not the best implementation but i am happy for the result as my first "serious" web project.
